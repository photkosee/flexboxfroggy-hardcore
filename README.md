## Feature
- Inputing CSS code to relocate the frogs to get back to their lily pads
- Unlimited levels

## Further improvement
- The difficulty of the game can be enhanced by adding order or align-self as an option for each individual frog.
- <s>The animation when transitioning to the next challenge can be added to smoothen the gameplay experience.</s> Completed
- Still need to take some cases that the inputs from users are not exactly the same with the solution but generating the same layout into account. Or find a better way to check the answer from users.
